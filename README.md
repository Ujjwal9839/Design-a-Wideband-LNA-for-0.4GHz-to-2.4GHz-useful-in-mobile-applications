# Design-a-Wideband-LNA-for-0.4GHz-to-2.4GHz-useful-in-mobile-applications
In this project, we intended to design a Wideband LNA for 0.4GHz to 2.4GHz useful in mobile applications with a low noise figure and sufficiently high gain and with proper input matching is take taken care.
This project is designed and simulated using Keysight ADS software.
This project uses the basic architecture of resistive feedback followed by a source follower for reactance cancelling and output buffer is added to drive a very small load of 50ohm.
